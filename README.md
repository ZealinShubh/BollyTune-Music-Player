## About the Project  
BollyTune-Music-Player is a lightweight web application designed to stream Bollywood songs in a user-friendly interface. Itâ€™s responsive (works on desktop & mobile) and built with front-end technologies only â€” no heavy backend required (just static files + JSON for song data).  
This project is perfect for developers wishing to explore audio handling on the web, UI/UX for media players, or to extend with features like playlists, search, offline support, etc.
